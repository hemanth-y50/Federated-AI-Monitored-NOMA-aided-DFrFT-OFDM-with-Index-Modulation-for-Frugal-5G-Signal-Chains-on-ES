# 🛰️ Federated AI-Monitored NOMA-aided DFrFT-OFDM with Index Modulation  
### _A Frugal 5G Signal Chain for Edge IoT and TinyML-Enabled ESP32 Systems_  

---

## 📖 Overview
This repository presents a **lightweight 5G/6G-compatible communication framework** that integrates  
**Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform (DFrFT)–based OFDM**, **Index Modulation (IM)**, and  
**Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)** with **Federated TinyML monitoring** deployed on ESP32-class edge devices.

The system enables **adaptive, privacy-preserving, and low-cost wireless connectivity** suitable for  
rural broadband, disaster-recovery, and large-scale IoT environments.

## 🚀 Key Contributions
- 🧠 **Federated TinyML-driven waveform adaptation** – Local ESP32 nodes predict modulation and power parameters based on SNR, BER, and PAPR.  
- ⚡ **DFrFT-OFDM with Index Modulation** – Reduces PAPR and improves spectral efficiency via fractional-domain rotation.  
- 📡 **NOMA-enabled multi-user fairness** – Power-domain superposition with successive interference cancellation (SIC).  
- 🔗 **Low-cost ESP32 deployment** – Real-time inference in ~40 ms per frame with <400 KB flash usage.  
- 📊 **Full simulation + embedded validation** – Python/MATLAB notebooks, waveform visualizations, and TinyML profiling included.
